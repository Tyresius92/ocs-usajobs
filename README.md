Project to download particular job descriptions from USAJobs API, and 
store them in a .csv file

The Fletcher School is seeking to plug holes in their curriculum, and 
has contracted with a company called VMock to do a skills gap analysis. 
As part of this process, VMock is developing career tracks based on the 
jobs our students would like to go into, and can then compare student 
resumes to the job tracks, and Fletcher can make sure that our courses 
fill the gaps, as appropriate.
